** 1. Introduction

This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles and mbp configuration. To install the dotfiles clone the repository, then =chmod +x create_symlinks.sh=.
The =create_symlinks.sh= script creates symlinks from all files in the =dotfiles/= directory to your home directory =~/=.

Before copying the dotfiles and pre-existing dotfiles will be copied to the =dotfiles_old/= directory in the repository.

*TL;DR* The install script will:
 - Back up any existing dotfiles in =~/= to =dotfiles_old/=
 - Create symlinks to the dotfiles in =dotfiles/= in your home directory
