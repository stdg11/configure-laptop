** 1. Dotfiles

This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles and mbp configuration. Firstly =chmod +x scripts/*= to make the scripts executable.
The =create_symlinks.sh= script creates symlinks from all files in the =dotfiles/= directory to your home directory =~/=.

Before copying the dotfiles and pre-existing dotfiles will be copied to the =dotfiles_old/= directory in the repository.

*TL;DR* The install script will:
 - Back up any existing dotfiles in =~/= to =dotfiles_old/=
 - Create symlinks to the dotfiles in =dotfiles/= in your home directory 
 
** 2. Drivers

To install the MacBook wireless drivers run =./scripts/install_drivers.sh=. This will:
 - Install =dkms_2.2.0.3-1.1ubuntu5_all.deb= allowing you to install Linux Kernel Modules
 - Install =bcmwl-kernel-source_6.30.223.141+bdcom-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb= the broadcom wireless drivers
*** TODO Update drivers
